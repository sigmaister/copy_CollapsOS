/* read stdin and strip Forth-style comments before spitting in stdout. This
also deduplicate spaces and newlines.

THIS PARSING IS IMPERFECT. Only a Forth interpreter can reliably detect
comments. For example, a naive parser misinterprets the "(" word definition as
a comment.

We work around this by considering as a comment opener only "(" chars preceeded
by more than once space or by a newline. Hackish, but works.
