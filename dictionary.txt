*** Glossary ***
Stack notation: "<stack before> -- <stack after>". Rightmost is top of stack
(TOS). For example, in "a b -- c d", b is TOS before, d is TOS after. "R:" means
that the Return Stack is modified. "I:" prefix means "IMMEDIATE", that is, that
this stack transformation is made at compile time.

Word references (wordref): When we say we have a "word reference", it's a
pointer to a words *code link*. For example, the label "PLUS:" in this unit is a
word reference. Why not refer to the beginning of the word struct? Because we
actually seldom refer to the name and prev link, except during compilation, so
defining "word reference" this way makes the code easier to understand.

Atom: A word of the type compiledWord contains, in its PF, a list of what we
call "atoms". Those atoms are most of the time word references, but they can
also be references to NUMBER and LIT.

Words between "()" are "support words" that aren't really meant to be used
directly, but as part of another word.

"*I*" in description indicates an IMMEDIATE word.

*** Defining words ***
(find)      a -- a f        Read at a and find it in dict. If found, f=1 and
                            a = wordref. If not found, f=0 and a = string addr.
: x ...     --              Define a new word
;           R:I --          Exit a colon definition
,           n --            Write n in HERE and advance it.
' x         -- a            Push addr of word x to a. If not found, aborts
['] x       --              *I* Like "'", but spits the addr as a number
                            literal. If not found, aborts.
(           --              *I* Comment. Ignore rest of line until ")" is read.
ALLOT       n --            Move HERE by n bytes
C,          b --            Write byte b in HERE and advance it.
CREATE x    --              Create cell named x. Doesn't allocate a PF.
[COMPILE] x --              Compile word x and write it to HERE. IMMEDIATE
                            words are *not* executed.
COMPILE x   --              Meta compiles. Kind of blows the mind. See below.
CONSTANT x  n --            Creates cell x that when called pushes its value
DELW        a --            Delete wordref at a. If it shadows another
                            definition, that definition is unshadowed.
DOES>       --              See description at top of file
IMMED?      a -- f          Checks whether wordref at a is immediate.
IMMEDIATE   --              Flag the latest defined word as immediate.
LITA        n --            Write address n as a literal.
LITN        n --            Write number n as a literal.
VARIABLE c  --              Creates cell x with 2 bytes allocation.

*** Flow ***
Note about flow words: flow words can only be used in definitions. In the
INTERPRET loop, they don't have the desired effect because each word from the
input stream is executed immediately. In this context, branching doesn't work.

(br)        --              Branches by the number specified in the 2 following
                            bytes. Can be negative.
(?br)       f --            Branch if f is false.
[           --              Begin interetative mode. In a definition, words
                            between here and "]" will be executed instead of
                            compiled.
]           --              End interpretative mode.
ABORT       --              Resets PS and RS and returns to interpreter
ABORT" x"   --              *I* Compiles a ." followed by a ABORT.
AGAIN       I:a --          *I* Jump backwards to preceeding BEGIN.
BEGIN       -- I:a          *I* Marker for backward branching with AGAIN.
ELSE        I:a --          *I* Compiles a (fbr) and set branching cell at a.
EXECUTE     a --            Execute wordref at addr a
IF          -- I:a          *I* Compiles a (fbr?) and pushes its cell's addr
INTERPRET   --              Get a line from stdin, compile it in tmp memory,
                            then execute the compiled contents.
QUIT        R:drop --       Return to interpreter prompt immediately
RECURSE     R:I -- R:I-2    Run the current word again.
THEN        I:a --          *I* Set branching cell at a.
UNTIL       f --            *I* Jump backwards to BEGIN if f is *false*.
